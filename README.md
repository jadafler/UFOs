# UFOs
Module 11

## Overview of Project
The main initiative for Dana is to offer users a customized, organized, and visually appealing site that can be used to dive into the world of UFO sightings. With Dana's hometown of McMinnville, OR being famously know for their UFO sightings and annual gatherings - this is a blast from the past where Dana can use her journalism skills to offer other enthusiasts a site for searching UFO sightings. Dana wanted to create a site that allowed users a customized experience providing the data with fiber features. 

## Results

At first visit the site offers a little background information along with a filter search (with default settings as placeholders, but not used for searching) along with a table pulling from the data set showing the date, city, state, country, shape duration, and comments regarding recorded UFO sightings.

The user can then select inputs by using the filter features: date, city, state, country, or shape. By selecting the city of Gulf Breeze, the user is able to see a return from Gulf Breeze, FL.

The user can further reduce the filter by selecting additional filters which can be seen here after selecting and confirming the date of 1/11/2010 and the shape as a triangle.

## Summary

Though the website is visually appealing and offers customization for the user to search for desired sightings. There are a few notes to consider:

<b>Drawback</b>
There is limited data within the file narrowing the search by date to 1/10 - 1/13 2010 and by needing to be a little familiar with the data listed in the default setting to accurately search for certain features. 

<b>Recommendations</b>
1. Adding a comment filter option would allow users to look more specifically for a similar experience or compare if UFO sightings are similar but not located within the same region or date. 

2. Offering a dropdown for features such as the shape so that it is more clear what terms are available for shape.
